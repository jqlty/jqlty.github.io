                        <p>
                            We are not responsible for Content residing in the ZipMaster. In no event shall we be held liable for any loss
                            of any Content. It is your sole responsibility to maintain appropriate backup of your Content. Notwithstanding
                            the foregoing, on some occasions and in certain circumstances, with absolutely no obligation, we may be able
                            to restore some or all of your data that has been deleted as of a certain date and time when we may have
                            backed up data for our own purposes. We make no guarantee that the data you need will be available.

                        <p>
                            Although this ZipMaster may link to other applications, we are not, directly or indirectly, implying any
                            approval, association, sponsorship, endorsement, or affiliation with any linked application, unless
                            specifically stated herein. Some of the links in the ZipMaster may be "affiliate links". This means if you
                            click on the link and purchase an item, ZipMaster will receive an affiliate commission. We are not responsible
                            for examining or evaluating, and we do not warrant the offerings of, any businesses or individuals or the
                            content of their applications. We do not assume any responsibility or liability for the actions, products,
                            services, and content of any other third-parties. You should carefully review the legal statements and other
                            conditions of use of any application which you access through a link from this ZipMaster. Your linking to any
                            other off-site applications is at your own risk.

                            To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, in no event will ZipMaster, its affiliates, officers,
                            directors, employees, agents, suppliers or licensors be liable to any person for (a): any indirect,
                            incidental, special, punitive, cover or consequential damages (including, without limitation, damages for lost
                            profits, revenue, sales, goodwill, use of content, impact on business, business interruption, loss of

                            apply if this remedy does not fully compensate you for any losses or fails of its essential purpose.
                        </p>
